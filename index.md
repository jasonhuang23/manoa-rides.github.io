# Development History

The development process for BowFolios conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell, development consists of a sequence of Milestones. Milestones consist of issues corresponding to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects are used to manage the processing of tasks during a milestone.  

The following sections document the development history of BowFolios.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on December 6, 2016 and ended on January 31, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and that FlowRouter was used to implement routing to the pages. 

Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

Milestone 1 was implemented as [BowFolio GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/milestone/1)::
