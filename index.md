# Development History

The development process for Manoa-Rides

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on November 14, 2017 and ended on November 22, 2017.

For milestone 1 the goal was to get mockups off all the page we wanted, and get an idea of what the completed application would look like.  

Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

Milestone 1 was implemented as [Manoa-Rides GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/manoa-rides/manoa-rides/milestones)::
